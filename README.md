# ANN

This repository contains the code and necessary components to create and train an ANN. The model can be customized with different architectures, activation functions, and optimization methods to fit various tasks. The following steps outline how the model is built, trained, and evaluated.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed and the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANN-Project.git
cd ANN-Project
Usage
To train the ANN model, modify the hyperparameters as required in the notebook or Python script and run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
For Jupyter Notebooks, simply open the .ipynb file and run the cells sequentially.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook ANN.ipynb
Input Data
The model accepts input data in [insert format, e.g., CSV, image files, etc.]. Make sure the dataset is pre-processed and split into training and testing sets before training the model.

Model Architecture
The ANN in this project consists of:

Input Layer: Accepts [input size, e.g., 28x28 images].
Hidden Layers: [Mention the number and size of hidden layers, activation functions used, etc.].
Output Layer: Provides the final classification or regression result.
The architecture can be customized by modifying the configuration in the source code or Jupyter notebook.

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using [mention the optimization algorithm, e.g., Adam optimizer] and [loss function, e.g., binary crossentropy, categorical crossentropy].

bash
Copy code
Epoch 1/10
Loss: 0.693
Accuracy: 85%
After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are reported.

Results
Training Accuracy: [insert percentage, e.g., 98%]
Test Accuracy: [insert percentage, e.g., 95%]
Confusion Matrix: [Optional: Show confusion matrix if it's a classification problem]
You can further visualize the results by generating plots using matplotlib for the loss and accuracy curves.
